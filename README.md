## View a demo of our app [here!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17lo8H7c34olpV6NPQBgg-QyN490d9NCq/view?usp=sharing) 

## Getting Started

MVC ( Model View Controller) software design pattern:-

* Model - model folder will contain models i.e. data structures/interfaces/classes
* View - view folder will contain all UI elements/widgets 
* Controller - controller folder will contain logical parts for example AuthController will have all the logic regarding user authentication

## instructions before pushing code

* default branch is master don't make direct changes to it
* before writing code make sure to get latest version code by git pull origin(use github desktop)
* after pulling write your code
* before pushing code to github create a new unique branch by using git checkout -b new_local_branch
* add files (git add .) and commit changes (git commit -m "describe commit")
* push changes to github - git push -u origin new_local_branch
* create a pull request from your branch to master branch on github website
* resolve conflicts and merge pull request
* once merged successfully delete your branch
* ====== never use forced push git push -f origin some-branch ===========
* :)
